#  Problem Statement
StackOverflow and Github do not provide us with a consolidated list of users that can specifically answer the question in the problem area though they provide resources and answers. The platforms sometimes do not provide specific solution or StackOverflow sometimes provides too many or too few solutions which make the user more confused. Software Developers face several issues like, finding User Wiki or help regarding a language or a new open source framework. 

Situations like these lead to an impasse, thus slowing the progress of the process. This is a problem because there are times a developer hits a roadblock, while trying to solve the problem, like an unresolved bug in a new open source framework (which may have been introduced due to the use of unverified code) or some backward compatibility issue in a particular language or framework. A portal that can provide an integrated solution to address the issue is needed. Our analytics portal comes into play here, to assist users out of their conundrums by recommending them a probable list of users who are the highly likely to answer the question of the developer. </br>

#  Solution Description
The solution to the problem described above is an analytics web portal designed primarily with a list of tags (languages, frameworks and technology) and a textbox to filter among those tags. The user can interact with the portal by clicking on the tags. On the portal the user will now get the relevant list of users, and visualizations for that particular tag which will be generated by using the capabilities of platforms like Tableau/PowerBI. Unlike StackOverflow our portal generates the list of users by using a combination of metrics like, average response time to particular query, number of verified answers per user and the popularity of the answer.

The user of the analytics portal can click on any StackOverflow user from the list to obtain the contact information or the link to Github repository. For example, from the list of StackOverflow users, Username: John Doe; Email: johndoe@userlist.com; Link to Github repository: www.github.com/johndoe/repo123. The user will also get a list of the trending Github repositories for the selected tag. Users will also have an opt-in/out option for a particular tag. So, if they choose to opt-in, everytime any new question is posted related to that tag, the user will get an email notification making our portal work on real-time and dynamic data.

#  Use Cases

## Use Case : 1
Use Case: The user gets a list of recommended users who can help with the problem tag.
### Preconditions: 
User must have a browser and an internet connection.
### Main Flow: 
[S1] User clicks on anyone of the tags/languages or filters them using the text box. </br>
[S2] On clicking the tag the portal gets a list of recommended StackOverflow Users who have a high probability of answering the user's question based on various metrics(like reponse time, verified answers,popularity on StackOverflow.) and visualizations based on which the list was recommended.
### Sub Flows:
[S1] User clicks a tag on the portal</br>
[S2] The portal gets a list of developers along with their StackOverflow Id and contact email if available </br>
[S3] The users can email the StackOverflow user for a quick response.
### Alternative Flow:
[S1] Tag/Language entered is not available on StackOverflow.

## Use Case : 2
Use Case: A software developer wants to refer some code regarding resolving a bug or finding a better implementation.
### Main Flow: 
[S1] User interacts with the portal by clicking on the tag of his problem domain.</br>
[S2] The analytics portal gives a list of top trending repositories on github for a particular language using the "github-trending api".
###  Sub Flows:
[S1] User either click on the tag where he is facing a problem or filter the tag from the text box</br>
[S2] Gets a list with that link to trending repositories for a particular language on github.
### Alternative Flow:
[S1] Tag/Language entered is not available on any of the sites or Incorrect data is entered.
[S2] No internet access or proxy blocking the github api.
 
## Use Case : 3
Use Case Problem: A software engineer wants to get updates/email notifications regarding the particular tag.
### Main Flow: 
[S1] User clicks the subscribe button for a particular tag </br>
[S3] The portal fetches top 10 questions and sends an email to the user everytime any activity happens regarding that tag.
###  Sub Flows:
[S1] The portal matches the string provided in the text field and returns a list of similar questions. </br>
[S2] The User gets an email notification depending on the frequency provided ( daily/weekly) containing links to all similar questions/threads.
### Alternative Flow:
[S1] Email Id is incorrect </br>
[S2] Email id / client blocks emails from the portal.

## Architecture Components Description

### Users
This component consits of different clients connect to the portal via a web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla.

### Application Layer
This layer works as a bridge between users and Middleware Layer. It will have a text box, popular tags and a search button. User can interact by searching about any of listed tags and page will then redirect the user to a page with the list of top developers who can help the user and relevant popular GitHub repositories, along with visualizations of the metrics based on which the list was generated. This component is built on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This information will be passed on to Middleware Layer.

### Middleware Layer
Middle Layer works as a mediator between Application Layer, Database Layer and Computational Logic Layer. It passes information to Database Layer received from Application Layer and then, sends back the result data in JSON format to Application Layer received from Computational Logic Layer. This component is built on Python and leverages REST services (HTTP Requests) to process the requests.

### Database Layer
This layer receives keyword information from Middleware Layer based on which it fetches relevant live data from StackOverFlow and GitHub and passes it to Computational Logic Layer. Also, stores the user's email subscription information for all threads.
Here, we will use JSON for data representation where each entity is an object.

### Computational Logic Layer
This layer works as a main heart of the portal where all the computations on the data received from Database Layer is done based on different metrics defined like, average response time to particular query, number of verified answers per user and the popularity of the answer. After this, layer returns list of top users, popular repositories for that keyword from GitHub and visual analysis using platforms like Tableau, and return it to Middleware Layer.

## Constraints/Guidelines 
- The portal requires an internet connection to process a request from the browser.
- Charts should be able to recieve numeric metric data for visualizations.
- Input should be in English characters.

## Design Pattern

Singleton Design Pattern will be used for developing this portal because it has a global point of access to the data store, which is a class implemented to store data from the REST APIs. The data store receives dynamic data from the APIs of Github and StackOverflow. So, here we would prefer to have a single instance of it which will coordinate with the different components of the user interface of the portal each time.
